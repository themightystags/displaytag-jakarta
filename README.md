displaytag-jakarta
==================

Fork of [displaytag](http://hazendaz.github.io/displaytag/) with updated code and dependencies to use classes / interfaces in the newer `jakarta.servlet` package which has replaced `javax.servlet`.

The changes here have been merged into the upstream project and released in version `3.0.0-M1`.  Please use that.  This fork is now redundant and is not maintained.
